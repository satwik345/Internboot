# Internboot Internship Project  
## Sales Analysis and Forecasting

###  Project Overview
The **Sales Analysis and Forecasting Project** focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **basic time-series forecasting** using real-world retail sales data.  
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle competition **“Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting”**, which contains historical sales data across multiple stores and product families.

This project is designed to build a strong foundation in **data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling**.
